/*
  SD card read/write
 
 This example shows how to read and write data to and from an SD card file 	
 The circuit:
 * SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MOSI - pin 11, pin 7 on Teensy with audio board
 ** MISO - pin 12
 ** CLK - pin 13, pin 14 on Teensy with audio board
 ** CS - pin 4, pin 10 on Teensy with audio board
